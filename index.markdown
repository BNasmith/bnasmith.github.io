Welcome to my website! 
I hope to use this space to share some things I find interesting and I hope you enjoy it. 
You can expect a mix of math and theology, as the title suggests. 

Why math and theology? 
I just happen to be interested in both, and fortunate enough to have spent some time studying them.

I've spent the past few years teaching undergraduate physics. My courses taught include modern physics, classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and physics of the space environment.


I am also a PhD candidate in mathematics, working toward completing my dissertation. 
I’m fascinated by exceptional or sporadic structures in combinatorics and algebra. My work focuses on structures of this type. 
Some of my specific interests include the quaternions, octonions, exceptional Jordan and Lie algebras, lattices, block designs, Steiner systems, codes, and algebras constructed from code loops.

A couple years ago I completed seminary and received a M.A. in Theological Studies. 
I enrolled in seminary part time for several years out of personal interest, to explore the foundations of my own faith and perspective. 
Along the way I became interested in a style of theology that draws upon our experiences.
Since graduating I’ve spent some time gathering archival writings on this theme, most of which are available on my other website:
[*Archive for Experiential Theology*](https://experientialtheology.hcommons.org/).
Along the way I’ve co-edited two books with Paul K. Moser, [*God of Holy Love: Essays of Peter Taylor Forsyth*](https://wipfandstock.com/god-of-holy-love.html) and [*God in Experience: Essays of Hugh Ross Mackintosh*](https://wipfandstock.com/god-in-experience.html). I hope that these books will put some of the writing that I’ve found most significant in the hands of those who might benefit from it.

If you read anything here that sparks your interested I’d be glad to hear from you.

Here is some LaTeX code. The imaginary number is $$i = \sqrt{-1}$$ and it is the solution to the equation,

$$
x^2 + 1 = 0.
